Stoop Sale Hackathon Project
Project Overview
Welcome to our Stoop Sale Hackathon project! In this project, we aimed to create a fun and interactive web application that simulates the experience of receiving a special invitation in an animated envelope. Hereâ€™s what we managed to accomplish:

Key Features
React Animation for Opening Envelope:

We implemented a React component that animates the opening of an envelope. This component adds a delightful visual touch, making the experience of receiving an invitation more engaging.
Interactive Countdown Timer:

Inside the opened envelope, we embedded an interactive countdown timer. The timer counts down to a specific date (August 1, 2024), adding a sense of urgency and anticipation for the event.
CSS Styling:

The envelope and its contents are styled using CSS to enhance the visual appeal. We carefully selected certain fonts to give the invitation a polished and inviting look.

What We Tried
API Integration (Unsuccessful Attempt):
We attempted to integrate an API to fetch dynamic content for the invitation but faced technical challenges that prevented it from working as intended. Despite this, we learned valuable lessons about API integration and troubleshooting.
Project Structure
Envelope.jsx:

This component handles the animation for the opening envelope and contains the invitation content.
CountdownTimer.jsx:

This component displays the countdown timer and is embedded within the Envelope.jsx component.
Styles:

We used CSS to style the envelope and its contents, ensuring a cohesive and attractive design.

Lessons Learned
Throughout this hackathon, we gained experience in:

Creating smooth animations in React.
Building and styling interactive components with CSS.
Working with countdown timers in a React environment.
Troubleshooting API integration issues.
Future Improvements
Successful API Integration:

We plan to revisit the API integration to fetch dynamic content for the invitation, making the application even more versatile.
Enhanced Animations:

We aim to refine the envelope animation for a more seamless and realistic experience.
Additional Features:

Adding more interactive elements and customization options to the invitation content.
Conclusion
Despite some challenges, we are proud of what we achieved during this hackathon. Our project showcases our ability to create engaging, visually appealing web applications using React and CSS. We look forward to further improving and expanding this project in the future.
